# Text Query Complaint Classfication Data Challenge

Text queries from customers classification into categories. This project was made in the context of a Data Challenge in 2023, for which I had 3 hours to complete. The goal was to construct a model to classify the complaints of customers, from a company, into categories. I had to chose an approach, justify it and at the end, express my recommendations to the company about the model and what they should do. I also concluded on improvements possible.
